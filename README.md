This is just the async rewrite I did of the internet archive python wrapper for my own use case. It does search/download/fetch. I hadn't used python in years when I rewrote it. Feel free to use it, rewrite it, tell me how bad my python is (don't be too harsh, I get my feelings hurt easy).

I haven't tested it in a bit. Currently swamped with Kodiak v1. There's likely dead code some places. This isn't polished. It's ugly, and moody. And I'm definitely not a fan of python. I'll get back to it again because I'll eventually need to. 
When I come back and polish it, this README will be updated

USE AT OWN RISK

My python code is like a microwaveable meal.
